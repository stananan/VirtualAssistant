# VirtualAssistant
Virtual Assistant I made with help from KTBYTE

Very basic commands only. 
To run the code, download the app, import the project to eclipse, run the main.java code in the ktbyte.assistant.java

Commands List -------
Asking the time
Definition of any word
Add, remove, clear, print a ToDoList
Asking the weather to a specific place


*THIS CODE WAS NOT CREATED BY ONLY ME. PARTS OF IT WERE CREATED BY THE TEAM AT KTBYTE AS A TEMPLATE*
